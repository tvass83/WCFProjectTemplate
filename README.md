**WCFProjectTemplate** is a multi-project Visual Studio extension to quickly get you started with WCF clients and services.

It's primary purpose is to provide the usual boilerplate code via a few clicks thus supporting quick experimentation with WCF.

It ships with a simple wizard that let's you specify things like  the generated type names; whether you want to create a duplex service; or use \"plain old XML\" (POX) style messaging instead of SOAP-based messaging.
